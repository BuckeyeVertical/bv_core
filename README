## Vision Node Test Plan:
To run the vision node I ran:
```
ros2 run bv_core vision_node
```

Then to artificially send the state to scan I ran this:
```
ros2 topic pub /mission_state std_msgs/String 'data: scan' -1
```

Then to feed the images I played the rosbag:
```
ros2 bag play bag_recording_1_0.db3
```

Then to see the detections outputted:
```
ros2 topic echo /obj_dets
```

Then to visualize the detections, I opened the annotations folder and checked out the annotated frames

# Filtering Node Test Plan:
Run the filtering node:
```
ros2 run bv_core filtering_node
```

Playing the bag file at 10x speed:
```
ros2 bag play -r 10.0 full_mission_test_4_0.db3
```

Echo the obj_dets topic:
```
ros2 topic echo /obj_dets
```

Optional: Echo the mission state topic:
```
ros2 topic echo /mission_state
```

# Cleaning the old ros logs:

You should clean the ros logs on your system frequently (especially on the jetson) since they stay indefinietly in the ros home directory and can eat up space on the system.

```
sudo rm -rf ~/.ros/log
```
