## Vision Node Test Plan:
To run the vision node I ran:
```
ros2 run bv_core vision_node
```

Then to artificially send the state to scan I ran this:
```
ros2 topic pub /mission_state std_msgs/String 'data: scan' -1
```

Then to feed the images I played the rosbag:
```
ros2 bag play bag_recording_1_0.db3
```

Then to see the detections outputted:
```
ros2 topic echo /obj_dets
```

Then to visualize the detections, I opened the annotations folder and checked out the annotated frames
